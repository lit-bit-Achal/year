      <p>Dear Crush, this is for you 🤞💖</p>
      <p>
        As I sit down to write this letter, my heart feels full of emotions that words can hardly capture. But I’ll try
        my best, because what I feel for you is too precious to remain unspoken. This letter is a humble attempt to
        share the depth of my love for you and the dreams I hold close to my heart—dreams in which you are the shining
        star.

        From the very moment we met, something deep within me shifted. I can’t pinpoint the exact second when you became my everything, but I know it happened slowly and then all at once. Your laughter, like a melody, lingers in the air long after it fades; your smile lights up not just the room but my entire world. And your kindness—oh, how it inspires me to be better, to strive for more, and to match the beauty of your soul with all the love I can give.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve always believed that love is not something you stumble upon—it’s something you build, nurture, and cherish. With you, I’ve come to understand this truth in ways I never thought possible. Every conversation we’ve shared, every moment we’ve laughed together, and every quiet second of just being in your presence has been like adding a brick to the foundation of something eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s so much I love about you, [Her Name]. Your ability to find joy in the simplest things reminds me to savor the beauty of life. The way you care for others so selflessly inspires me to give more of myself. Your dreams and passions are as dazzling as the stars, and the way you chase them fills me with admiration. I love how you see the world—not through a lens of cynicism but with a heart full of hope and wonder. And most of all, I love how you make me feel—safe, understood, and utterly complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve often thought about what a future with you would look like. I imagine a home filled with love, laughter, and the shared pursuit of happiness. I picture us building traditions of our own, supporting each other’s dreams, and growing stronger together with every challenge we face. I see us growing old side by side, our hands intertwined, our hearts forever bound. These are not just idle fantasies; they are the vision of my life’s greatest dream—a life spent with you.
      </p>

    <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
      <img src="1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240">
      <p>
        There are so many little things about you that I’ve fallen in love with—the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you’re passionate about, the way you crinkle your nose when you’re deep in thought, and even the way you hold your coffee cup like it’s the most precious thing in the world. These details, these quirks, make you uniquely you, and I wouldn’t trade them for anything in this universe.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 6)">
      <p>
        But love is not just about the grand gestures or the perfect moments. It’s also about the quiet, unspoken promises we make to each other every day. It’s about standing by each other’s side through life’s storms, celebrating the triumphs, and holding on tightly through the challenges. With you, I’m ready for all of it—the ups, the downs, and everything in between. I want to be the person you lean on when times get tough, the one who cheers the loudest when you achieve your dreams, and the one who makes you feel loved every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I write this, I realize that no amount of words can fully express the depth of my feelings for you. But I hope you can see the sincerity in my heart and the love that spills out with every word. You are my best friend, my confidant, my greatest supporter, and my heart’s truest desire. I cannot imagine a life without you in it, and I don’t want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I am, taking a leap of faith, asking you to take this journey with me. [Her Name], will you marry me? Will you be my partner, my love, my everything, for the rest of our days? I promise to love you fiercely, to support you unconditionally, and to always strive to make you as happy as you make me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="page text-page">
      <p>
        You are my greatest blessing, and I want to spend the rest of my life cherishing you. Whatever the future holds, I know that as long as we’re together, it will be beautiful.
      </p>

      <p>You are My Everything 💖.</p>
